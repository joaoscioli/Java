# Deep traversal (DFS) of a graph in Java
Write a Java program that performs a deep traversal (DFS) of an undirected graph represented as an adjacency list. Deep traversal is a technique for exploring all the nodes of a graph by following the edges as far as possible before going back.

You need to code the path logic in depth in Java and make sure that your program works correctly. You can also add comments to explain your code.
Example of a solution in Java :

In this example, we have represented an undirected graph as an adjacency list and performed a deep traversal (DFS) starting from a start node. The result is displayed as the order in which the nodes are visited during the traversal. You can customise the graph by modifying the edges or choosing a different starting node to explore different parts of the graph.
