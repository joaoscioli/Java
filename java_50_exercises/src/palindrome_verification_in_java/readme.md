# Palindrome verification in Java
Write a Java program that checks whether a character string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same from left to right and right to left, ignoring case, punctuation and spaces.
You need to code the palindrome checking logic in Java and make sure that your program works correctly. You can also add comments to explain your code.
Example of a solution in Java :
In this example, we've used an isPalindrome function to check whether a string is a palindrome. The program asks the user to enter a string, then uses the isPalindrome function to remove punctuation, ignore case and spaces, and then check whether the string is a palindrome using a two pointer technique. The program displays a message indicating whether or not the string is a palindrome.
