# Calculating the power of a number in Java
Write a Java program that calculates the power of a number. The user must enter the base (a number) and the exponent (a non-negative integer). The program must calculate the value of the base raised to the power of the exponent and display it.
You need to code the logic for calculating the power in Java, also handling the case where the exponent is a negative number, and make sure that your program works correctly. You can add comments to explain your code.
Example of a solution in Java :
In this example, we have used a for loop to calculate the power of the base raised to the exponent. The program asks the user to enter the base and exponent, checks that the exponent is a non-negative integer, then calculates the power and displays it. The power of the base to the 0th power is defined as 1.
