# Kruskal algorithm for the minimal spanning tree in Java
Write a Java program that implements Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimal spanning tree of an undirected weighted graph. The minimal spanning tree is a subgraph that is a tree, i.e. it is cycle-free, and spans all the nodes of the original graph with minimal total weight.

You need to code the logic of Kruskal's algorithm in Java and make sure that your program works correctly. You can also add comments to explain your code.
Example of a solution in Java :

In this example, we represented an undirected weighted graph as a list of edges with weights. We then run Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimal spanning tree. The program displays the edges of the minimal spanning tree and their total weights. You can customise the edges of the graph to see how Kruskal's algorithm finds the minimal spanning tree in different graphs.
