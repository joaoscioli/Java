# Calculating the sum of the digits of a number in Java
Write a Java program that calculates the sum of the digits of an integer. The user enters an integer, and the program calculates the sum of its digits.
You need to code the logic for calculating the sum of the numbers in Java and make sure that your program works correctly. You can also add comments to explain your code.
Example of a solution in Java :
In this example, we have used a while loop to calculate the sum of the digits of an integer. The program asks the user to enter a number, then uses the while loop to extract the last digit at each iteration, add it to the sum and remove that digit from the number. The loop repeats until the number becomes zero. The program then displays the sum of the digits.
