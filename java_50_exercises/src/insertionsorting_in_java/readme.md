# Insertion sorting in Java
Write a Java program to sort an array of integers using the insertion sort algorithm. The insertion sort algorithm consists of successively inserting each unsorted element in its correct position among the sorted elements, from left to right.
You need to code the insertion sort logic in Java and make sure that your program works correctly. You can also add comments to explain your code.
Example of a solution in Java :

In this example, we have used the insertion sort algorithm to sort an array of integers. The program asks the user to enter the size of the array and the elements, then uses a loop to insert each unsorted element in its correct position among the sorted elements. This operation is repeated until the entire array is sorted.
