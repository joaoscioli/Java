# Mergesort in Java
Write a Java program to sort an array of integers using the merge sort algorithm (Mergesort). The merge sort algorithm is based on the "divide and conquer" method by dividing the array into two halves, sorting these halves, then merging the sorted halves to obtain a sorted array.
You need to code the fusion sorting logic in Java and make sure that your program works correctly. You can also add comments to explain your code.
Example of a solution in Java :

In this example, we have used the Mergesort algorithm to sort an array of integers. The program asks the user to enter the size of the array and the elements, then uses recursion to sort the array by dividing, sorting and merging the sub-arrays.
