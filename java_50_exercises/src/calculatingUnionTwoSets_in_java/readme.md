# Calculating the union of two sets in Java
Write a Java program that calculates the union of two sets of integers. The user must enter the elements of the two sets, and the program must determine and display the elements that are present in at least one of the sets (i.e. the union).

You need to code the logic for calculating the union of sets in Java and make sure that your program works correctly. You can also add comments to explain your code.
Example of a solution in Java :

In this example, we have used the findUnion function to calculate the union of two sets of integers. The program asks the user to enter the size and elements of the two sets, then uses the function to find the elements that are present in at least one of the sets. The union elements are stored in an ArrayList and displayed at the end. Using the addAll method adds all the elements of the sets to the union.
