# Sorting by selection in Java
Write a Java program to sort an array of integers using the selection sort algorithm. The selection sort algorithm consists of finding the smallest element in the array and placing it in the first position, then repeating this process for the rest of the array.
You need to code the sort-by-selection logic in Java and make sure that your program works correctly. You can also add comments to explain your code.
Example of a solution in Java :

In this example, we have used the selection sort algorithm to sort an array of integers. The program asks the user to enter the size of the array and the elements, then uses a double loop to find the minimum element in the unsorted portion of the array and places it in the correct position. This operation is repeated until the entire array is sorted.
