# Finding cycles in a graph in Java
The aim of this exercise is to write a Java program to detect the presence of cycles in a directed or undirected graph. You can choose to work with one of the graph types.

## Part 1 - Statement :
Write a Java program that allows a user to enter or represent a graph with its vertices and edges, and then detects whether it contains cycles.

## Part 2 - Example of a solution in Java :
Here is an example of a solution in Java for detecting cycles in an undirected graph using depth-first search (DFS):

This example shows how to detect cycles in an undirected graph using depth-first search (DFS). The program lets you create a graph, add edges and then check it for cycles. You can customise the graph by adding or modifying edges to test different scenarios.
