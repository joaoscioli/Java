# Calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers in Java
Write a Java program that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two given numbers. The GCD is the largest integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.
You need to code the logic for calculating the PGCD in Java and make sure that your program works correctly. You can also add comments to explain your code.
Example of a solution in Java :
In this example, we have used Euclid's algorithm to calculate the GCD of two numbers. The program asks the user to enter the two numbers, then uses a while loop to repeat the steps of Euclid's algorithm until b becomes zero. The PGCD is then equal to a. The programme then displays the PGCD of the two numbers entered.
