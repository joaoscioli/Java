# Checking the uniqueness of elements in an array in Java
Write a Java program that checks whether all the elements of an array are unique, i.e. there are no duplicates in the array. The user must enter the size of the array and the elements of the array, and the program must determine whether or not all the elements are unique.
You need to code the logic for checking the uniqueness of elements in Java and make sure that your program works correctly. You can also add comments to explain your code.
Example of a solution in Java :
In this example, we have used a HashSet to check the uniqueness of the elements in the array. The program asks the user to enter the size of the array and the elements, then uses the checkForDuplicates function to check whether the array contains any duplicates. If an element cannot be added to the set (because it is already present), the program concludes that there are duplicates. Otherwise, it displays that all the elements are unique.
