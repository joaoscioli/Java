# Topological sorting of a directed graph in Java
Write a Java program that performs a topological sort of a directed graph represented as an adjacency list. Topological sorting is a way of ordering the nodes of a graph so that each node precedes all the nodes it reaches by an edge. The program must take the graph as input and display the topological sort order.

You need to code the topological sorting logic in Java and make sure that your program works correctly. You can also add comments to explain your code.
Example of a solution in Java :

In this example, we have represented a directed graph as an adjacency list and performed a topological sort using an algorithm based on the in-degrees of the nodes. The result is displayed as the topological sort order of the graph. You can customise the graph by modifying the edges to see how the topological sort order changes as a result.
