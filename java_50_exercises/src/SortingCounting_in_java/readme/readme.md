# Sorting by counting in Java
The exercise involves writing a Java program that implements the Counting Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order. Counting Sort is a non-comparative sorting algorithm that counts the number of occurrences of each element in the array, then constructs a new sorted array based on these counts.

## Part 1 - Statement :
Write a Java program to sort an array of integers using the count sort algorithm. The program needs to determine the range of possible values in the array to determine the number of "counters" required.
