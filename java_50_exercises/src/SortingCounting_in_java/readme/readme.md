# Sorting by counting in Java
The exercise involves writing a Java program that implements the Counting Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order. Counting Sort is a non-comparative sorting algorithm that counts the number of occurrences of each element in the array, then constructs a new sorted array based on these counts.

## Part 1 - Statement :
Write a Java program to sort an array of integers using the count sort algorithm. The program needs to determine the range of possible values in the array to determine the number of "counters" required.

## Part 2 - Example of a solution in Java :
Here is an example of a solution in Java that uses the counting sort algorithm to sort an array of integers:

This example solution in Java uses the count sort algorithm to sort an array of integers. The program first determines the range of possible values, counts the occurrences of each value and then constructs a sorted array using the counters. You can customise the input array to test count sorting with different data sets.
