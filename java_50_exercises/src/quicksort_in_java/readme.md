# Quicksort in Java
Write a Java program to sort an array of integers using the quicksort algorithm. The quicksort algorithm is an efficient sorting algorithm based on the divide-and-conquer method. It selects a pivot element, partitions the array into two sub-arrays (elements below the pivot and elements above the pivot), then recursively sorts these sub-arrays.
You need to code the quick sort logic in Java and make sure your program works correctly. You can also add comments to explain your code.
