# Calculating the number of digits in an integer in Java
Write a Java program that calculates the number of digits in an integer. The user enters an integer, and the program counts and displays the number of digits in the integer.
You need to code the logic for calculating the number of digits in Java and make sure that your program works correctly. You can also add comments to explain your code.
Example of a solution in Java :

In this example, we have used a while loop to count the number of digits in an integer. The program asks the user to enter a number, then uses the while loop to increment the counter on each iteration and delete the last digit of the number. The loop repeats until the number becomes zero. The program then displays the number of digits in the number entered.
