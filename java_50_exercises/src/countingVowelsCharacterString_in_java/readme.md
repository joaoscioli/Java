# Counting vowels in a character string in Java
Write a Java program that counts the number of vowels (letters a, e, i, o, u) in a string. The user enters a string, and the program counts the number of vowels in the string and displays the result.
You need to code the vowel counting logic in Java and make sure that your program works correctly. You can also add comments to explain your code.
Example of a solution in Java :
In this example, we have used a countVowels function to count the number of vowels in a string. The program asks the user to enter a string, then uses the countVowels function to convert the string to lower case, then scans the string character by character to count the vowels. The program then displays the number of vowels in the string.
