# Calculating the factorial of a number in Java
Write a Java program that calculates the factorial of a given number. The factorial of a positive integer n is the product of all the positive integers from 1 to n.
You need to code the logic for calculating the factorial in Java and make sure that your program works correctly. You can also add comments to explain your code.
Example of a solution in Java :
In this example, we have used a for loop to calculate the factorial of a given positive integer. The program asks the user to enter a number, then checks whether it is positive. If it is, it calculates the factorial by multiplying the integers from 1 to n, otherwise it indicates that the factorial is only defined for positive integers. The factorial of 0 and 1 is defined as being equal to 1.
