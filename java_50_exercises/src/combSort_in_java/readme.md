# Comb Sort in Java
The exercise involves writing a Java program that implements the Comb Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order. Comb Sort is a variation of Bubble Sort that swaps elements at a fixed distance instead of swapping adjacent elements, making it more efficient.

## Part 1 - Statement :
Write a Java program to sort an array of integers using the comb sort algorithm. Comb sorting starts with a large gap between the elements to be compared, then progressively reduces this gap until it reaches zero, thus carrying out comparisons and exchanges efficiently.
