# Comb Sort in Java
The exercise involves writing a Java program that implements the Comb Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order. Comb Sort is a variation of Bubble Sort that swaps elements at a fixed distance instead of swapping adjacent elements, making it more efficient.

## Part 1 - Statement :
Write a Java program to sort an array of integers using the comb sort algorithm. Comb sorting starts with a large gap between the elements to be compared, then progressively reduces this gap until it reaches zero, thus carrying out comparisons and exchanges efficiently.

## Part 2 - Example of a solution in Java :
Here is an example of a solution in Java that uses the comb sort algorithm to sort an array of integers:

This example solution in Java implements the comb sort algorithm to sort an array of integers. The program starts with a large gap between the elements to be compared, then progressively reduces this gap using a reduction factor. You can customise the input array to test comb sorting with different data sets.
