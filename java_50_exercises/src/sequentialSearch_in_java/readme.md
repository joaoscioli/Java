# Sequential search in Java
Write a Java program to perform a sequential search in an array of integers. Sequential search is a simple algorithm that consists of going through the array element by element until the element you are looking for is found or the entire array has been searched.
You need to code the sequential search logic in Java and make sure that your program works correctly. You can also add comments to explain your code.
Example of a solution in Java :

In this example, we have used the sequential search algorithm to find an element in an array. The program asks the user to enter the size of the array, the elements of the array and the element to be searched for. It then performs the sequential search to find the element and displays its position if it is found, or indicates if it has not been found. Sequential search is simple but can be less efficient than other methods for large arrays, as it traverses all the elements in the array.
