# Inverting a character string in Java
Write a Java program that inverts a string of characters. The user enters a string, and the program inverts the characters in the string and displays the result.
You need to code the string inversion logic in Java and make sure that your program works correctly. You can also add comments to explain your code.
Example of a solution in Java :
In this example, we have used a character array to store the characters in the string and then used a two pointer technique to invert the characters. The program asks the user to enter a string, then uses a while loop to invert the characters by swapping the characters in the left and right positions. The inverted string is then displayed.
