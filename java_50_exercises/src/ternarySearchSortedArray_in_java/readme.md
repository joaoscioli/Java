# Ternary search in a sorted array in Java
The exercise involves writing a Java program to implement the ternary search algorithm in a sorted array. The ternary search is a variant of the binary search which divides the array into three equal parts and compares the element being searched with the elements in the middle two thirds.

## Part 1 - Statement :
Write a Java program to perform a ternary search in a sorted array of integers. The ternary search algorithm divides the array into three equal parts and compares the element searched for with the elements in the middle two thirds. If the element is found, return its index. Otherwise, indicate that the element is not present in the array.
