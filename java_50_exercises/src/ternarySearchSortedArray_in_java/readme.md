# Ternary search in a sorted array in Java
The exercise involves writing a Java program to implement the ternary search algorithm in a sorted array. The ternary search is a variant of the binary search which divides the array into three equal parts and compares the element being searched with the elements in the middle two thirds.

## Part 1 - Statement :
Write a Java program to perform a ternary search in a sorted array of integers. The ternary search algorithm divides the array into three equal parts and compares the element searched for with the elements in the middle two thirds. If the element is found, return its index. Otherwise, indicate that the element is not present in the array.

## Part 2 - Example of a solution in Java :
Here is an example of a solution in Java for a ternary search in a sorted array:

This example solution in Java implements a ternary search in a sorted array. The program takes a sorted array and a target element as input, then performs the ternary search to find the element. If the element is found, its index is returned. Otherwise, a message indicating that the element was not found is displayed. You can customise the sorted array and target value to perform ternary searches with different data sets.
