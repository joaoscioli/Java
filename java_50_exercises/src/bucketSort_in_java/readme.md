# Bucket Sort in Java
The exercise involves writing a Java program that implements the Bucket Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order. Bucket Sort is a non-comparative sorting algorithm that divides the elements of the array into 'drawers' or 'buckets' according to their value, then sorts these drawers individually. It then combines the sorted drawers to obtain the final sorted array.

## Part 1 - Statement :
Write a Java program to sort an array of integers using the pigeonhole sorting algorithm. The program must take into account the range of possible values of the integers in the array in order to distribute the elements into the drawers.

## Part 2 - Example of a solution in Java :
Here is an example of a solution in Java that uses the pigeonhole sorting algorithm to sort an array of integers:

This example solution in Java uses the pigeonhole sorting algorithm to sort an array of integers. The program first determines the range of possible values, creates drawers for each possible value, places the elements in the drawers, sorts the elements in each drawer and then combines the sorted elements to obtain the final sorted array. You can customise the input array to test pigeonhole sorting with different data sets.
