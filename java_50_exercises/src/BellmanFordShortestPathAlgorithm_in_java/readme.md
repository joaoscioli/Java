# Bellman-Ford shortest path algorithm in Java
Write a Java program that implements the Bellman-Ford algorithm to find the shortest path between a starting node and all other nodes in a weighted directed graph, including detection of negative cycles. The Bellman-Ford algorithm is used to solve the shortest path problem, including graphs with negative weight edges, while detecting negative cycles.

You need to code the logic of the Bellman-Ford algorithm in Java and make sure that your program works correctly. You can also add comments to explain your code.
Example of a solution in Java :

In this example, we have represented a weighted directed graph as an adjacency list with weights on the edges, then performed the Bellman-Ford algorithm from a starting node. The program displays the minimum distances from the start node to all other nodes and detects negative cycles if present. You can customise the graph by changing the edges and weights to see how the minimum distances and negative cycle detection work accordingly.
