# Calculating the intersection of two sets in Java
Write a Java program that calculates the intersection of two sets of integers. The user must enter the elements of the two sets, and the program must determine and display the elements that are present in the two sets (i.e. the intersection).
You need to code the logic for calculating the intersection of sets in Java and make sure that your program works correctly. You can also add comments to explain your code.
Example of a solution in Java :

In this example, we have used the findIntersection function to calculate the intersection of two sets of integers. The program asks the user to enter the size and elements of the two sets, then uses the function to find the elements that are present in both sets. The intersection elements are stored in an ArrayList and displayed at the end. The contains method is used to check whether an element is present in a set.
