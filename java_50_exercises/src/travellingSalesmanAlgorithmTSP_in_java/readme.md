# Travelling Salesman Algorithm (TSP) in Java
The Travelling Salesman Algorithm (TSP) is a combinatorial optimisation problem that involves finding the shortest route through a set of cities and back to the starting city. In this exercise, you will implement a solution to solve the TSP using the brute force search algorithm.





## Part 1 - Statement :
Write a Java program to solve the TSP problem using the exhaustive search method. You will need to find the optimal permutation of cities (the order in which the traveller visits them) that minimises the total distance travelled. You can represent the distances between cities in the form of a matrix or an adjacency list.

## Part 2 - Example of a solution in Java :
Here is an example of a solution in Java that uses the exhaustive search method to solve the TSP with a matrix of distances between cities:
