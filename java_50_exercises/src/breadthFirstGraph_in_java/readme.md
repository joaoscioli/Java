# Breadth-first graph (BFS) in Java
Write a Java program that performs a breadth-first traversal (BFS) of an undirected graph represented as an adjacency list. Breadth-first traversal is a technique for exploring all the nodes in a graph by starting with a starting node and iteratively moving to its nearest neighbours.

You need to code the breadth logic in Java and make sure that your program works correctly. You can also add comments to explain your code.
Example of a solution in Java :

In this example, we have represented an undirected graph as an adjacency list and performed a breadth-first traversal (BFS) from a start node. The result is displayed as the order in which the nodes are visited during the breadth traversal. You can customise the graph by modifying the edges or choosing a different starting node to explore different parts of the graph.
