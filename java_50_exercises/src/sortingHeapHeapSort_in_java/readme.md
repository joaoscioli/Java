# Sorting by heap (Heapsort) in Java
The exercise involves writing a Java program that implements the heapsort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order. Heapsort is a sorting algorithm based on the heap data structure, which allows the array to be sorted efficiently.

## Part 1 - Statement :
Write a Java program to sort an array of integers using the heap sort algorithm. The algorithm starts by creating a heap from the array, then extracts the elements from the heap one by one and places them in the sorted array.
