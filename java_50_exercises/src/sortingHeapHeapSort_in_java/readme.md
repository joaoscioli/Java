# Sorting by heap (Heapsort) in Java
The exercise involves writing a Java program that implements the heapsort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order. Heapsort is a sorting algorithm based on the heap data structure, which allows the array to be sorted efficiently.

## Part 1 - Statement :
Write a Java program to sort an array of integers using the heap sort algorithm. The algorithm starts by creating a heap from the array, then extracts the elements from the heap one by one and places them in the sorted array.

## Part 2 - Example of a solution in Java :
Here is an example of a solution in Java that uses the heap sort algorithm to sort an array of integers

This example solution in Java implements the heap sort algorithm to sort an array of integers. The program first creates a max heap from the array, then extracts the elements from the heap one by one and places them in the sorted array. You can customise the input array to test heap sorting with different data sets.
