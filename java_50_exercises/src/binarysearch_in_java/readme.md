# Binary search in Java
Write a Java program that performs a binary search in a sorted array of integers. Binary search is an efficient algorithm that searches for an element in a sorted array by recursively dividing the array into two parts and comparing the element searched for with the element in the middle. If the element searched for is equal to the element in the middle, the algorithm returns the position of this element in the array. Otherwise, the algorithm reduces the search to the half of the array in which the element could be found.
You need to code the binary search logic in Java and make sure that your program works correctly. You can also add comments to explain your code.
Example of a solution in Java :

In this example, we have used the binary search algorithm to find an element in a sorted array. The program asks the user to enter the size of the sorted array, the elements of the array and the element to be searched for. It then performs the binary search to find the element and displays its position if it is found, or indicates if it has not been found.
