# Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm in Java
Write a Java program that implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between a starting node and all other nodes in a weighted directed graph. Dijkstra's algorithm is widely used to solve the shortest path problem.

You need to code the logic of Dijkstra's algorithm in Java and make sure that your program works correctly. You can also add comments to explain your code.
Example of a solution in Java :

In this example, we have represented a weighted directed graph as an adjacency list with weights on the edges, then performed Dijkstra's algorithm starting from a start node. The program displays the minimum distances from the start node to all other nodes. You can customise the graph by changing the edges and weights to see how the minimum distances are calculated accordingly.
