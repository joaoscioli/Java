# Bubble Sorting in Java
Write a Java program to sort an array of integers using the bubble sort algorithm. The bubble sort algorithm works by comparing and swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order, and repeats this process until the whole array is sorted.
You need to code the bubble sort logic in Java and make sure that your program works correctly. You can also add comments to explain your code.
