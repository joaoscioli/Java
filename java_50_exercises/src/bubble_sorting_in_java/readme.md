# Bubble Sorting in Java
Write a Java program to sort an array of integers using the bubble sort algorithm. The bubble sort algorithm works by comparing and swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order, and repeats this process until the whole array is sorted.
You need to code the bubble sort logic in Java and make sure that your program works correctly. You can also add comments to explain your code.

In this example, we have used an array of integers to store the elements, and the bubble sort algorithm is implemented inside two for loops. The program asks the user to enter the size of the array and the elements of the array, then displays the sorted array at the end.
