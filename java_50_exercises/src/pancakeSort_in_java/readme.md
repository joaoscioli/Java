# Pancake Sort in Java
The exercise involves writing a Java program that implements the pancake sort algorithm (Pancake Sort) to sort an array of integers in ascending order. Pancake Sort is a sorting algorithm that returns the elements of the array in order to sort them.

## Part 1 - Statement :
Write a Java program to sort an array of integers using the pancake sort algorithm. The pancake sort algorithm returns the elements of the array to sort them progressively. You can only return elements from the first position in the array.

## Part 2 - Example of a solution in Java :
Here is an example of a solution in Java that uses the pancake sort algorithm to sort an array of integers
This example solution in Java implements the pancake sort algorithm to sort an array of integers. The program uses rollover operations to sort the array progressively. You can customise the input array to test pancake sorting with different data sets.
