# Pancake Sort in Java
The exercise involves writing a Java program that implements the pancake sort algorithm (Pancake Sort) to sort an array of integers in ascending order. Pancake Sort is a sorting algorithm that returns the elements of the array in order to sort them.

## Part 1 - Statement :
Write a Java program to sort an array of integers using the pancake sort algorithm. The pancake sort algorithm returns the elements of the array to sort them progressively. You can only return elements from the first position in the array.
