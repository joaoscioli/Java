# Exponential search algorithm in Java
The exercise involves writing a Java program to implement the exponential search algorithm. The exponential search algorithm is used to search for an element in a sorted array by recursively dividing the array into sub-arrays of exponential size.

## Part 1 - Statement :
Write a Java program to perform an exponential search in a sorted array of integers. The exponential search algorithm recursively divides the array into sub-arrays of exponential size and compares the element searched for with the element in the middle of each sub-array. If the element is found, return its index. Otherwise, indicate that the element is not present in the array.

## Part 2 - Example of a solution in Java :
Here is an example of a solution in Java for the exponential search algorithm:

This example solution in Java implements the exponential search algorithm. The program takes a sorted array and a target element as input, then performs the exponential search to find the element. If the element is found, its index is returned. Otherwise, a message indicating that the element was not found is displayed. You can customise the sorted array and target value to perform exponential searches with different data sets.
