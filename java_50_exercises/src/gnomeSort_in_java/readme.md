# Gnome Sort in Java
The exercise involves writing a Java program that implements the gnome sort algorithm (Gnome Sort) to sort an array of integers in ascending order. Gnome Sort is a simple sort-in-place algorithm that moves the elements of the array from left to right until the array is sorted.

## Part 1 - Statement :
Write a Java program to sort an array of integers using the gnome sort algorithm. The gnome sort algorithm starts at the first position in the array, then moves the elements to the right until they are correctly sorted.

## Part 2 - Example of a solution in Java :
Here is an example of a solution in Java that uses the gnome sorting algorithm to sort an array of integers:

This example solution in Java implements the gnome sort algorithm to sort an array of integers. The program starts at the first position in the array, then moves the elements to the right until they are correctly sorted. You can customise the input array to test gnome sorting with different data sets.
