# Gnome Sort in Java
The exercise involves writing a Java program that implements the gnome sort algorithm (Gnome Sort) to sort an array of integers in ascending order. Gnome Sort is a simple sort-in-place algorithm that moves the elements of the array from left to right until the array is sorted.

Part 1 - Statement :
Write a Java program to sort an array of integers using the gnome sort algorithm. The gnome sort algorithm starts at the first position in the array, then moves the elements to the right until they are correctly sorted.
