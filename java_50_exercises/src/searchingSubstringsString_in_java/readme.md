# Searching for substrings in a string in Java
Write a Java program that searches for all occurrences of a given substring in a string. The user must enter a string and a substring, and the program must find and display all the positions where the substring appears in the string.
You need to code the substring search logic in Java and make sure your program works correctly. You can also add comments to explain your code.
Example of a solution in Java :

In this example, we have used the findSubstringPositions function to search for all occurrences of a substring in a string. The program asks the user to enter the main string and the substring to search for, then uses the function to find and display all the positions where the substring appears. The indexOf method is used to find the positions of the substring in the main string, and a while loop is used to find all occurrences.
