# Calculation of the least common multiple (LCMM) of two numbers in Java
Write a Java program that calculates the least common multiple (LCMM) of two given numbers. The LCMM is the smallest positive integer that is a common multiple of the two numbers.
You need to code the PPCM calculation logic in Java and make sure that your program works correctly. You can also add comments to explain your code.
Example of a solution in Java :
In this example, we have used Euclid's algorithm to calculate the PGCD of two numbers, then we have used the relationship between the PGCD and the PPCM to calculate the PPCM. The program asks the user to enter the two numbers, then calculates the PPCM using the formula (a * b) / gcd(a, b). The PPCM is then displayed.
