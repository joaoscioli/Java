#Calculating the difference between two sets in Java
Write a Java program that calculates the difference between two sets of integers. The user must enter the elements of the two sets, and the program must determine and display the elements that are present in the first set but not in the second (i.e. the difference).

You need to code the logic for calculating the difference of sets in Java and make sure that your program works correctly. You can also add comments to explain your code.
Example of a solution in Java :

In this example, we've used the findDifference function to calculate the difference between two sets of integers. The program asks the user to enter the size and elements of the two sets, then uses the function to find the elements that are present in the first set but not in the second. The difference elements are stored in an ArrayList and displayed at the end. The contains method is used to check whether an element is present in the second set.
