# Bubble sorting optimised in Java
The exercise involves writing a Java program that implements the optimised bubble sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order. Bubble Sort is a simple algorithm that traverses the array, comparing neighbouring elements and swapping them if necessary to order them correctly. The algorithm continues to traverse the array until no swaps are made on a complete pass, indicating that the array is sorted.

## Part 1 - Statement :
Write a Java program to sort an array of integers using the optimised bubble sort algorithm. Optimised bubble sorting is an improvement on classic bubble sorting that stops the sorting process as soon as it detects that no exchange is necessary during a complete pass.

This example solution in Java implements the optimised bubble sort algorithm to sort an array of integers. The program takes an array as input, performs the optimised bubble sort and then displays the sorted array. You can customise the input array to test the optimised bubble sort with different data sets.

## Part 2 - Example of a solution in Java :
Here is an example of a solution in Java that uses the optimised bubble sort algorithm to sort an array of integers:

This example solution in Java implements the optimised bubble sort algorithm to sort an array of integers. The program takes an array as input, performs the optimised bubble sort and then displays the sorted array. You can customise the input array to test the optimised bubble sort with different data sets.
